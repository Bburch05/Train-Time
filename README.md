# Train-Time

The purpose of this is to display a knowledge of using Firebase database and being able to get data from a database to produce content dynamically.

It also uses Moment.js to calculate the closest time that the train will arrive at.

By adding the required data to the form and hitting the submit button you send the data from the form to the database which the page then reads and adds to the table.
